                        <h2>The development of programming languages (0 to now):</h2>
                        <p>Introduction
                            Programming languages can be divided into different categories. These categories provide
                            software developers with different levels of abstraction and capabilities to develop
                            software solutions. Machine code consists of instructions executed and understood by a
                            computer processor. The code is composed of binary digits indicating actions and operations
                            the processor performs. Assembly languages are programming languages that provide a low
                            level of abstraction between machine code and higher-level programming languages. Assembly
                            languages use text symbols and abbreviations. Higher-level programming languages are
                            designed to allow programmers to write code at a more abstract level. An example of a
                            higher-level programming language is Javascript. Fourth-generation languages, also known as
                            4GL, are programming languages designed to facilitate the development of software
                            applications through higher levels of abstraction and automation. An example of a 4GL
                            language is SQL. Object-oriented languages, also known as OOP languages, are programming
                            languages that make it easier to design and maintain complex systems. An example of an
                            object-oriented language is Python.

                                    <p>C++ is a programming language used to build a wide range of software, from games and
                                    applications to system software. In simple terms, it's a tool that developers use to
                                    write code that can be executed by a computer. C++ is known for its efficiency and
                                    versatility, making it suitable for tasks that require high performance, such as
                                    game development, system programming, and creating software for various applications
                                    and industries.</p>
